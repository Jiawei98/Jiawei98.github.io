My research centers on the development and application of statistical methodology for complex business data. I creates tools for <u>discrete data analysis</u> and the integration of <u>large language models</u> to analyze mixed-type and unstructured survey data. In parallel, I advance <u>machine learning and deep learning</u> methods (penalized regression, neural networks, etc.) for high-dimensional, multimodal data, with applications in Asset Pricing, Organizational Behavior, and Gene–Environment Interaction. 

- *Methodology*: Discrete Data Analysis, Nonparametric Statistics, Penalized Regression, Machine/Deep Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), High-Dimensional and Multimodal Analysis, Qualitative Comparative Analysis

- *Application*: Survey Analysis, Social Mobility, Financial Asset Pricing, Organizational Behavior, Information Systems, Gene–Environment Interaction
