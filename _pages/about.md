# Hi! I'm Jiawei,

My name is Jiawei Huang, and I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Business Analytics in the Department of Operations, Business Analytics, and Information Systems at the Carl H. Lindner College of Business, University of Cincinnati. Prior to UC, I earned a M.S. in Data Science and Statistics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison (2021) and a B.S. in Statistics from Renmin University of China (2020). Here is my CV: [CV Link](/files/CV_Jiawei_Huang_UC.pdf).

My research centers on the development and application of statistical methodology for complex business data. I creates tools for <u>discrete data analysis</u> and the integration of <u>large language models</u> to analyze mixed-type and unstructured survey data. In parallel, I advance <u>machine learning and deep learning</u> methods (penalized regression, neural networks, etc.) for high-dimensional, multimodal data, with applications in Asset Pricing, Organizational Behavior, and Gene–Environment Interaction. Currently in ABD status, I am actively seeking academic positions beginning in 2026.

I will present my paper in the following sessions at the 2025 INFORMS Annual Meeting in Atlanta. Feel free to attend and connect with me!

- Data Mining and Decision Analytics (DMDA) Workshop, Oct 25th

- Job Market Showcase Session, Oct 28th
