# Hi! I'm Jiawei,

My name is Jiawei Huang, and I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Business Analytics in the Department of Operations, Business Analytics, and Information Systems at the Carl H. Lindner College of Business, University of Cincinnati. Prior to UC, I earned a M.S. in Data Science and Statistics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison (2020) and a B.S. in Statistics from Renmin University of China (2019).

My research centers on the development and application of statistical methodology for complex business data. I creates tools for **discrete data analysis** and the integration of **large language models** to analyze mixed-type and unstructured survey data. In parallel, I advance **machine learning and deep learning** methods (penalized regression, neural networks, etc.) for high-dimensional, multimodal data, with applications in Asset Pricing, Organizational Behavior, and Gene–Environment Interaction. 

Currently in ABD status, I am actively seeking academic positions beginning in 2026. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
