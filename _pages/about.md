# About Me

My name is Jiawei Huang, and I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Business Analytics in the Department of Operations, Business Analytics, and Information Systems at the Carl H. Lindner College of Business, University of Cincinnati. Prior to UC, I earned an M.S. in Data Science and Statistics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison (2020) and a B.S. in Statistics from Renmin University of China (2019).

My research centers on the application of statistical methods, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to business problems. Currently in ABD status, I am actively seeking academic positions beginning in 2026.
